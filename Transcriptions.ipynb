            "[03:35.500 --> 03:42.740]  We may be just one yard apart, speaking to each other, seeing, hearing and perhaps even\n",

            "[03:45.300 --> 03:52.500]  Yet we have no idea what each of us is thinking and what we really want.\n",
            "[03:52.500 --> 03:58.780]  Perhaps in this very minute we are thinking about someone living in a different place or even\n",
            "[03:58.780 --> 04:01.820]  at a different time.\n",
            "[04:01.820 --> 04:05.220]  We all say we love the Master.\n",
            "[04:05.220 --> 04:12.780]  It is for certain that we all know that people in love are the most boring people to talk to.\n",
            "[04:12.780 --> 04:26.100]  They may be standing right in front of us, but their minds are constantly on the charming, lovely, wonderful, smart, loved one.\n",
            "[04:26.100 --> 04:36.060]  We should all naturally agree that this should be our state of mind if we really mean our love to our Master.\n",
            "[04:36.060 --> 04:43.380]  Whether it is so, let the lovers of the Master answer for themselves.\n",
            "[04:43.380 --> 04:52.740]  Further we say, we love each other dearly as all of us are dearly seeking the same Master.\n",
            "[04:52.740 --> 05:04.060]  Yet, if we are asked as to who was sitting by our side during the meditation, it is doubtful whether we would come forward to answer.\n",
            "[05:04.060 --> 05:11.380]  If there were to be an answer, it is obvious that the object of love was not the one.\n",
            "[05:11.380 --> 05:25.380]  But we know, there are lovers of the Master who say that the meditation was affected because of the person who was before him throwing out the entire person's dirt on them.\n",
            "[05:25.380 --> 05:35.340]  Therefore, so many other judgments of others are made by these types of persons, and the veil, their love of the Master could not be expressed fully.\n",
            "[05:35.340 --> 05:46.480]  But it must be clearly understood that during our deep emergence in the thought or consciousness of our beloved Master, we recognize none but him.\n",
            "[05:47.440 --> 05:56.260]  It is thus clear that we think, feel and imagine what we feel close to and what we really want.\n",
            "[05:56.260 --> 06:11.840]  It is obvious that we can only detect what our senses can perceive.\n",
            "[06:11.840 --> 06:20.380]  The eye, for example, can perceive images by receiving specific wavelengths between the colors purple and red.\n",
            "[06:21.840 --> 06:28.860]  That is why we cannot see shorter wavelengths than purple, such as ultraviolet, with the naked eye.\n",
            "[06:30.040 --> 06:32.940]  A bee, on the other hand, does see ultraviolet.\n",
            "[06:32.940 --> 06:42.000]  And this enables it to detect different kinds of flowers that we humans would not be able to distinguish.\n",
            "[06:43.420 --> 06:54.640]  We all know that our world contains many frequencies, most of which we cannot receive, although they do affect us, like the radio or X-ray waves.\n",
            "[06:54.640 --> 07:08.160]  But the right instrument that can translate these waves to a length, our sense organs can perceive, we will be able to detect those waves in the space around us.\n",
            "[07:08.160 --> 07:25.060]  If we are asked, what is being broadcast right now, on our favorite radio station, we would most likely say that we do not know.\n",
            "[07:26.020 --> 07:32.380]  But if we turn on the radio and switch to the frequency of our favorite station, we would immediately answer.\n",
            "[07:32.380 --> 07:40.860]  This is due to the fact that the radio fixes itself to work on a frequency that existed in the air before we turned it on.\n",
            "[07:41.500 --> 07:49.040]  It helps us transform the message created in the radio station from an undetectable wavelength to one our ears can detect.\n",
            "[07:49.960 --> 07:53.480]  The law of equivalence of form works in the spiritual world also.\n",
            "[07:53.840 --> 08:01.240]  But in spirituality, it is all about similarity and dissimilarity of intentions.\n",
            "[08:02.380 --> 08:05.240]  Not about equivalence of frequencies.\n",
            "[08:06.060 --> 08:09.780]  All that is measured in the spiritual world are intentional thoughts.\n",
            "[08:10.940 --> 08:19.740]  The intention of the pranasya pranaha that governs the whole reality, including our lives, is only to bestow, to give.\n",
            "[08:20.780 --> 08:21.860]  It acts out of love.\n",
            "[08:22.700 --> 08:29.340]  If we want to know and understand how the world is ruled, we should also acquire the intention to bestow.\n",
            "[08:29.340 --> 08:41.320]  If we concentrate on ourselves and on our personal benefit, we will not know the reasons for everything that happens around and within us,\n",
            "[08:41.320 --> 08:59.540]  since we remain detached from the superior force of pranasya pranaha.\n",
            "[08:59.540 --> 09:12.200]  It is only when our consciousness equalizes with the divine, we discover the true nature of all things and how all are intertwined and in the process find happiness and peace.\n",
            "[09:13.560 --> 09:18.020]  No one other than the master has stated this principle of equivalence better.\n",
            "[09:18.020 --> 09:26.700]  By being in complete oneness with the master, it follows that if master is merciful, we should become merciful.\n",
            "[09:27.420 --> 09:30.860]  As he is called gracious, we are also to be gracious.\n",
            "[09:31.620 --> 09:34.480]  As he is called holy, we too shall be holy.\n",
            "[09:34.480 --> 09:41.820]  The importance of complying with the Ten Commandments of the Master can be easily understood when we know these implications.\n",
            "[09:42.700 --> 09:51.960]  We then shall become personifications of forbearing, compassionate, righteous and all such good, noble and godly qualities.\n",
            "[09:52.740 --> 10:01.140]  Oneness with the Master or God shall lie in conducting ourselves in such a way to resemble him as much as one can.\n",
            "[10:01.140 --> 10:07.740]  I request all to study in depth the lives of the masters and educate the children in this regard.\n",
            "[10:08.500 --> 10:12.160]  That is our duty and should be our way of loving the master.\n",
            "[10:12.860 --> 10:15.380]  Master said, love him who loves all.\n",
            "[10:16.000 --> 10:21.240]  I would prefer to appeal, live in such a manner that he would live in us.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

            "[01:23.400 --> 01:33.880]  It may not be in the beginning stages. As we advance, it will be there. So, when you see the paper and when you don't see that it's tallied, then at that time you may look at the screen.\n",
            "[01:33.880 --> 01:44.320]  Our Master asserts that mind can know mind and divinity can know divinity. And the implication is clear that mind cannot know the divinity.\n",
            "[01:45.660 --> 01:51.860]  The sentence of the Master taken for the seminar is a part of the message given by him at Channapatna in 1972.\n",
            "[01:51.860 --> 02:06.200]  He states clearly in this message that intellectuality works in its own narrow sphere and we should always take the broader view of things and widen it so that it may be able to cross its own boundary.\n",
            "[02:07.300 --> 02:13.180]  Mind thus is stated to be of the nature of binding us to our own notions and dogmas.\n",
            "[02:13.180 --> 02:21.120]  Our mind, Master has clarified elsewhere, consists of four parts, chitta, manas, buddhi and ahankar.\n",
            "[02:22.020 --> 02:33.060]  He asserted that a purified mind with its constituent parts only will give correct understanding and it is the instrument that we have to use to know our true nature.\n",
            "[02:33.060 --> 02:38.980]  In fact, it is on this axiom the whole of Raja Yoga is explained by him.\n",
            "[02:40.080 --> 02:45.200]  Yet he makes the statement that mind can know mind and divinity the divinity.\n",
            "[02:46.120 --> 02:55.800]  There is a clue here to understand that in fact they are not polar opposites but is made so by many depending on mind exclusively to know reality.\n",
            "[02:55.800 --> 03:07.620]  Explaining the origin of mind, he stated in the message given at the time of the centenity celebration of Mahatma, Sri Nam Chandra Ji Maharaj of Vatheghar in 1973\n",
            "[03:07.620 --> 03:13.320]  that when the balance was disturbed, we came into existence.\n",
            "[03:14.180 --> 03:16.560]  I do not want to elaborate the subject metaphysically.\n",
            "[03:17.540 --> 03:22.200]  The thought for creation stirred up near about the center and energy began to flow out.\n",
            "[03:22.760 --> 03:23.420]  What was that?\n",
            "[03:23.420 --> 03:29.480]  That is the first mind, pure and simple, and that has woven all our frame and structure.\n",
            "[03:30.400 --> 03:33.160]  It brought purity with it, which is still maintained.\n",
            "[03:34.080 --> 03:43.320]  So, when we begin to give wrong suggestions, the mind which is absolutely pure repels them in order to maintain its eternal purity.\n",
            "[03:44.360 --> 03:48.120]  Thus we understand that the mind is pure and divine in its nature.\n",
            "[03:48.120 --> 03:57.000]  This leads us to think whether two types of mind exist in us, one leading us to the divine and the other away from it.\n",
            "[03:57.000 --> 04:04.480]  This is the point that Lord Krishna tried to answer when he said that human beings are of two types,\n",
            "[04:04.960 --> 04:09.480]  one of the divine, daivi nature, and the other demonic or asuric.\n",
            "[04:09.480 --> 04:20.840]  He who practices, we who practice the Sri Nam Chandra's Raja Yoga, know that our lower mind denoted by the portion marked as L in the heart,\n",
            "[04:21.000 --> 04:27.520]  as explained in the book Efficacy of Raja Yoga, has to be transcended and move to the higher mind,\n",
            "[04:28.320 --> 04:31.720]  marked as you, to start knowing reality.\n",
            "[04:31.720 --> 04:41.960]  We know, we have on earlier occasions noted that the duality exists not only at the mental, astral level,\n",
            "[04:42.240 --> 04:55.980]  but at the physical level of brain also, by noting the different functions of the right and left hemispheres of the brain.\n",
            "[04:55.980 --> 05:08.560]  In the message under consideration, we have to naturally think that the mind referred to by the Master is a lower mind.\n",
            "[05:10.320 --> 05:17.600]  Explaining the power of mind, Master has said that it is of the same nature as show and has its roots in the divine.\n",
            "[05:18.380 --> 05:25.140]  A powerful will made at the very first step and maintained all through shall never fail to achieve complete success.\n",
            "[05:25.140 --> 05:34.560]  However, the problem is that we really do not know how to make that will, and we always found ourselves no wiser for the advice.\n",
            "[05:35.740 --> 05:41.600]  The lower mind has its own logic and reasons to give us not to work for achieving the objective.\n",
            "[05:42.260 --> 05:46.800]  We know while making this statement, Master is revealing the power of the mind.\n",
            "[05:47.460 --> 05:53.220]  He was saying that we can achieve our objective if we instruct our mind and subconscious mind properly.\n",
            "[05:53.220 --> 06:03.980]  Unfortunately, most of us do not know how to instruct the mind or subconscious mind, though all that is required is simple suggestion.\n",
            "[06:04.780 --> 06:12.880]  However, our mind is accustomed to complicated ideas and beliefs, and therefore the easy task becomes very difficult.\n",
            "[06:13.880 --> 06:18.980]  Therefore, we end up getting the mind and subconscious mind creating things we really do not want.\n",
            "[06:18.980 --> 06:25.120]  This is the problem of many aspirants, which the Master himself has clarified when he said,\n",
            "[06:25.600 --> 06:31.840]  the thinking has become so rough that they always add their own impure thoughts in the span of nature.\n",
            "[06:32.840 --> 06:37.400]  Complexities after complexities are there, and it is the creation of the human brain.\n",
            "[06:37.400 --> 06:52.000]  If we do not get our mind and subconscious mind to focus on what we want, we will surely end up getting what we do not want during meditation, in particular, and life in general.\n",
            "[06:52.840 --> 06:59.300]  Master states in the same article that the present question before the world is how to lead a happy life.\n",
            "[06:59.300 --> 07:07.020]  It is but natural that everyone wants to be successful and happy, but we do not have thoughts that reflect success and happiness.\n",
            "[07:07.800 --> 07:20.040]  Very few of us choose our thoughts, and majority of sadhakas leave their mind on an autopilot, accepting whatever thought it conjures up, and then they begin to worry about them.\n",
            "[07:20.920 --> 07:23.360]  Master only advised us to ignore the thoughts.\n",
            "[07:23.360 --> 07:26.200]  If we do that, there is no problem.\n",
            "[07:26.700 --> 07:31.920]  Instead, we seem to believe in the reality of these thoughts and veil over such a situation.\n",
            "[07:32.800 --> 07:42.980]  What we should believe is a Master, whose presence is felt as peace, balance, accompanied by an awareness of nothing, and many a time, non-awareness of anything.\n",
            "[07:42.980 --> 07:54.360]  When Master also advised us to think or imagine that there is a divine light without luminosity, and meditate, he advised that we should ignore all thoughts while meditating.\n",
            "[07:55.200 --> 08:02.840]  He assured that the suggestion given at the beginning of meditation will continue to work at the subconscious level throughout the period of meditation.\n",
            "[08:02.840 --> 08:17.020]  The unregulated mind has its own way of making us doubt the Master, and we seem to get active with our ideas generated by the mind, which has got clouded through cardinality and relationships.\n",
            "[08:17.020 --> 08:27.200]  We do not give importance to the presence of the Master by believing in him, instead, we give importance to the unwanted thoughts and believe in their reality.\n",
            "[08:28.160 --> 08:35.040]  We thus do not choose our beliefs based on experience, and instead, we merely accept what our lower minds tell.\n",
            "[08:35.040 --> 08:40.460]  This is how the impure mind fails us in our task.\n",
            "[08:41.220 --> 08:47.260]  Mind is its own enemy, that Krishna very emphatically said in the Bhagavad Gita.\n",
            "[08:48.100 --> 08:53.460]  Master also says this, but adds, the same mind has to be used to control the mind.\n",
            "[08:53.460 --> 09:08.220]  When we hear sadhakas, who are intent on being successful in their spiritual pursuit, and try to analyze their thoughts, we find them entertaining thoughts, which are in their very nature the exact opposite of what they seek.\n",
            "[09:09.020 --> 09:15.300]  While they want to be successful, they do not show any evidence of having thoughts and beliefs that promote their cause.\n",
            "[09:15.300 --> 09:23.760]  Master, when asked us, Master, when asked us, to have yawning, he was only hinting at this, we seek, but do not yarn.\n",
            "[09:25.600 --> 09:33.820]  If we want to achieve success in our endeavor, then we have to create thoughts and beliefs that will allow us achieve the goals.\n",
            "[09:34.520 --> 09:39.000]  We can think of our mind as a station that sends out energy signals.\n",
            "[09:39.660 --> 09:42.020]  These energy signals are our thoughts and beliefs.\n",
            "[09:42.020 --> 09:45.780]  These energy patterns are picked up by our subconscious mind.\n",
            "[09:46.400 --> 09:52.640]  It then works out and creates situations, circumstances, and events to help us achieve whatever we seek.\n",
            "[09:53.280 --> 09:58.940]  It also attracts the people to us and guides us to the people who can help us achieve our goals.\n",
            "[09:59.560 --> 10:06.900]  This is what is meant by the sentence often used by the Masters, that when we are ready, the Master comes to our doorsteps.\n",
            "[10:06.900 --> 10:12.520]  The subconscious does not distinguish between what is good and bad for us.\n",
            "[10:12.520 --> 10:14.820]  It simply acts on our instructions.\n",
            "[10:15.600 --> 10:20.820]  Those instructions are our energy signals, which are, as we mentioned earlier, our thoughts.\n",
            "[10:21.500 --> 10:29.220]  So while we may want to achieve realization, our lower mind, impure as it is, does not allow us to think that we can.\n",
            "[10:29.220 --> 10:40.420]  And if we regularly maintain that notion, either as a mark of humility or fear of incapacity, or we are indoctrinated to that effect by the Sanyasis,\n",
            "[10:40.980 --> 10:50.760]  that we cannot achieve the same, we should know we are instructing our lower mind to create situations for us that will not enable us to achieve our goals.\n",
            "[10:50.760 --> 10:57.920]  This is why it is so important to eliminate negative thinking and create a positive thinking pattern in spirituality.\n",
            "[10:58.640 --> 11:06.820]  It is in this context we should understand the value of the advice of the Master that we should have faith in us that we can reach the goal.\n",
            "[11:07.660 --> 11:14.560]  It becomes clear that if we want to achieve our goal and live the life of natural cooperation that we want,\n",
            "[11:14.560 --> 11:19.900]  we have to send a right message, we have to send the right messages to our subconscious mind.\n",
            "[11:20.440 --> 11:27.000]  It is a matter that is not readily acceptable to our mind because this appears to be naive and simple.\n",
            "[11:27.700 --> 11:30.080]  But that is a matter suggested by our Master.\n",
            "[11:30.740 --> 11:36.700]  If we examine whether the entertaining of patterns of negative thinking is helping us, we find that it does not.\n",
            "[11:37.400 --> 11:41.120]  That type of defeatist mentality enables only to get defeated.\n",
            "[11:41.120 --> 11:49.600]  When we get calmness and peace during the meditation, if our attention goes to these states of divinity, we progress faster.\n",
            "[11:50.280 --> 11:53.980]  It is these states of divinity that know and lead us to divinity.\n",
            "[11:54.580 --> 11:57.920]  That is how we can say divinity knows divinity.\n",
            "[11:58.760 --> 12:04.720]  But for this to happen, we should be clear that divinity reveals itself through calmness and peace.\n",
            "[12:04.720 --> 12:14.240]  The importance of having one method, one Master, and the absolute faith in our own deservency to reach the goal cannot be overemphasized in Sadhana.\n",
            "[12:15.080 --> 12:19.700]  These statements of the Master are based on very sound principles of science, of mind.\n",
            "[12:20.260 --> 12:24.100]  We should have unflinching faith in our mind and its capacities.\n",
            "[12:24.760 --> 12:32.660]  However, even as I stated earlier, it becomes reliable only when it is pure, or in other words, is the higher mind.\n",
            "[12:32.660 --> 12:37.360]  In any inquiry into the nature of things, three aspects are to be remembered.\n",
            "[12:38.140 --> 12:41.780]  One, the object sought to be known should be clearly defined.\n",
            "[12:42.540 --> 12:45.780]  Two, the instrument of knowing should be pure and clean.\n",
            "[12:46.600 --> 12:49.100]  Thirdly, the knower should be objective.\n",
            "[12:49.100 --> 12:56.360]  In any attempt to know the workings of mind, the instrument and the knower happen to be the same.\n",
            "[12:56.920 --> 13:02.820]  And many times, the object of observation itself is an aspect of mind or one of its processes.\n",
            "[13:03.820 --> 13:08.960]  I beg your pardon to repeat my old example to explain this.\n",
            "[13:08.960 --> 13:16.940]  Imagine a bee somehow entered a room which has closed doors and window panes.\n",
            "[13:17.500 --> 13:19.400]  The bee tries to get out of the room.\n",
            "[13:20.860 --> 13:24.080]  It sees its freedom through the glass window panes.\n",
            "[13:24.840 --> 13:28.280]  But however much it tries, it is not able to get out of the same.\n",
            "[13:28.280 --> 13:34.340]  Similarly, the seeker of freedom sees the opportunities for freedom through the window of mind.\n",
            "[13:34.880 --> 13:36.800]  But he is not able to get out of the window.\n",
            "[13:37.780 --> 13:45.980]  The seeker like the bee can somehow sense the freedom and even experience it from time to time.\n",
            "[13:46.560 --> 13:52.740]  But this he does only through the window of the mind.\n",
            "[13:52.740 --> 13:57.360]  The seeker may truly be sincere in the longing for freedom.\n",
            "[13:58.320 --> 14:02.140]  The misfortune is that regardless of what is attained or experienced,\n",
            "[14:02.700 --> 14:08.400]  one remains inside the mind and continues to search with the mind.\n",
            "[14:09.120 --> 14:13.480]  This is one of the tough problems we face due to our formal training and education.\n",
            "[14:14.240 --> 14:20.280]  We have had occasion to discuss this aspect while we discuss problems of sadhana in Vijnanamaya Korsha.\n",
            "[14:20.280 --> 14:26.640]  Master, while giving his method indirectly, helped our mind find its futility.\n",
            "[14:27.600 --> 14:30.940]  Our master has asked us to meditate on divine light without luminosity.\n",
            "[14:31.740 --> 14:37.040]  This is an impossible concept for the mind and it is forced to stare at this idea.\n",
            "[14:39.820 --> 14:46.540]  In doing so, he has blocked the way of the mind for the seeker and left open the way to freedom.\n",
            "[14:46.540 --> 14:53.700]  Further, by assisting the seeker through prana huti, which informs the nature of pure and unalloyed consciousness,\n",
            "[14:54.320 --> 14:55.620]  he opened the path to freedom.\n",
            "[14:56.300 --> 15:01.120]  In real spiritual training, the mind has to be made silent and put to rest.\n",
            "[15:01.880 --> 15:03.920]  Master, therefore, called himself a silencer.\n",
            "[15:04.920 --> 15:10.800]  Thus, it is divinity that can know the divinity and the mind can never know the source of its origin.\n",
            "[15:10.800 --> 15:15.780]  For an individual, the way to divinity is silence.\n",
            "[15:16.400 --> 15:19.040]  And in that silence, the window of the mind disappears.\n",
            "[15:19.700 --> 15:26.400]  This is what happens when we receive prana huti and experience the real silence beyond all comprehension of the mind.\n",
            "[15:27.260 --> 15:34.280]  We realize it is our true nature to be free and all the bondages are our creation having no reality content.\n",
            "[15:34.280 --> 15:42.680]  In fact, there are no windows or window panes and they are all creations of our individual mind.\n",
            "[15:43.320 --> 15:49.660]  Even as either or error, all that exists is free and it is our mind that creates the boundaries.\n",
            "[15:50.460 --> 15:55.880]  Boundaries of earth and water are human in origin and are illusions created by us.\n",
            "[15:56.460 --> 15:59.020]  That is why disputes about them never abate.\n",
            "[15:59.020 --> 16:05.380]  We cannot conceive of the defense ministry without these boundaries of dubious origin and sanctity.\n",
            "[16:06.180 --> 16:10.520]  Perhaps, human mind requires many a tsunami to understand this.\n",
            "[16:11.200 --> 16:15.920]  In fact, all our inquiry or search into the nature of our being through mind\n",
            "[16:15.920 --> 16:22.940]  is an exercise similar to the blind man seeking for a black cat in a dark room which is not there.\n",
            "[16:23.660 --> 16:27.000]  We erroneously look for something that is never lost.\n",
            "[16:27.000 --> 16:32.960]  Our true nature because of our nature because our nature is not a thing.\n",
            "[16:34.200 --> 16:36.680]  However, the mind is not to be shunned.\n",
            "[16:37.420 --> 16:43.520]  Its true nature of being universal without the limitations of the ego, relationships and ideas.\n",
            "[16:44.080 --> 16:46.460]  If recognized, it is itself the freedom.\n",
            "[16:47.140 --> 16:50.660]  Such recognition of freedom renders the mind benign and useful.\n",
            "[16:50.660 --> 16:56.640]  We need to see what the mind is and also what it is not.\n",
            "[16:57.480 --> 17:02.880]  The mind has a creative genius and therefore enjoys a parallel status with that of the divine.\n",

            "[03:28.400 --> 03:39.400]  Naturally, that requires courage and absolute faith in the Master and we are happy that we could bring many aspirants to that state of being lions in the path.\n",

            "[04:35.400 --> 04:46.400]  More so in the case of trainers, there was a stress laid on their owning up the condition so that their service to the aspirants would be of a high order.\n",
            "[04:46.400 --> 04:58.400]  Recently, we heard a very ingenious yet ill-informed argument that if the trainers were to own up the conditions, what will Riviera Babaji do?\n",
            "[04:58.400 --> 05:05.400]  And it was added that this means that Riviera Babaji does not exist in ISRC.\n",
            "[05:05.400 --> 05:16.400]  This argument derives its sap from the notions mentioned above which were popular in some circles of disciples of the Master but which are never true.\n",
            "[05:16.400 --> 05:37.400]  Their belief maintains the notion that Pranaputi flows up from the blues or directly from the heart of the Master and the Master would work according to the need automatically and the trainers need to do nothing except sit and get honored for such a noble job.\n",
            "[05:37.400 --> 05:48.400]  This and many such magical and mysterious notions of such an effect from Pranaputi were sought to be cleared off in one of our latest publications, Pranaputi.\n",
            "[05:48.400 --> 06:03.400]  The Pranaputi is the willpower of a person who is advanced in Raja Yoga and who can foment to another with his own internal power has been stated very clearly more than once.\n",
            "[06:03.400 --> 06:26.400]  The notions about Pranaputi in any other manner and thinking that the Master does all the work is surely the desire of those who would like to call themselves as aspirants and trainers but would crave and indulge in realms of sloth, laziness, unaccountability and irresponsibility.\n",
            "[06:26.400 --> 06:31.400]  There is some error in thinking among our associates.\n",
            "[06:31.400 --> 06:45.400]  They feel that service is a means of progress in spirituality and donate in cash and kind liberally to Sarajeva Samstan which does lot of noble service.\n",
            "[06:45.400 --> 06:58.400]  The quality of service rendered by Sarajeva Samstan is well appreciated by the governmental agencies as well as funding agencies which have inspected the institutions of Sarajeva Samstan.\n",
            "[06:58.400 --> 07:13.400]  However, I may be permitted to clarify that it is those who are advanced in spirituality and stepped into the universal consciousness and lived in altruistic consciousness that feel the genuine need for service.\n",
            "[07:13.400 --> 07:20.400]  It is not as though whoever does social service moves to higher realms in spirituality.\n",
            "[07:20.400 --> 07:30.400]  An article by Dr. KCB on service to mankind was published in our Satyapadam more than once just to clarify these types of notions.\n",
            "[07:30.400 --> 07:53.400]  I appeal to aspirants clearly to understand that spiritual training that we seek to impart to the ISRC and its sister wing imperious has nothing whatsoever to do to Sarajeva Samstan which is run of course by the aspirants following the ISRC whose character and nobility is of a very high order.\n",
            "[07:53.400 --> 07:54.400]  It is true.\n",
            "[07:54.400 --> 07:55.400]  It is true.\n",
            "[07:55.400 --> 08:04.400]  We say that since SSS is doing good work, fellow brethren may help that organization grow in a manner in which they think they can.\n",
            "[08:04.400 --> 08:08.400]  It is said that it takes one to know one.\n",
            "[08:08.400 --> 08:20.400]  What this really means is that we cannot feel, see or experience something in someone else unless it is also inside us.\n",
            "[08:20.400 --> 08:38.460]  So, if one could feel, see or experience appreciation, respect, happiness, excitement, conversation, compatibility, humor, inner peace, extreme support and deep meaningful passion in one's mirror,\n",
            "[08:39.140 --> 08:46.780]  we should appreciate that person for having amazing qualities of what may be called love.\n",
            "[08:46.780 --> 08:51.780]  Many aspirants seek to know their condition in spiritual life.\n",
            "[08:51.780 --> 08:58.780]  For this they should be attentive during meditation and other practices connected with sadhana.\n",
            "[08:58.780 --> 09:06.780]  Attentiveness is effective in noting the arising of our thoughts and recognizing the contents of our thoughts and beliefs.\n",
            "[09:06.780 --> 09:15.780]  It is particularly useful in changing the self-limiting beliefs we have that is preventing us from unlimited possibilities.\n",
            "[09:15.780 --> 09:27.780]  Since changing these unconscious or self-limiting beliefs requires that we first identify them, attentiveness plays a crucial role in this identification process.\n",
            "[09:27.780 --> 09:39.780]  When we are attentive to the thoughts and beliefs in our mind, we can then work on replacing beliefs that limit us with wholesome and life enhancing ones.\n",
            "[09:39.780 --> 09:42.780]  How can we increase our attentiveness?\n",
            "[09:42.780 --> 09:44.780]  We will do that through meditation.\n",
            "[09:44.780 --> 09:57.780]  In which, those of the aspirants who ask how to be attentive during meditation may kindly note that continuous meditation alone enables us to be attentive to our states of mind.\n",
            "[09:57.780 --> 10:14.780]  Meditation, when done on a regular basis, increases our attentiveness about the object of meditation and allows us to gradually peel off layers upon layers of negative mental and emotional imprints, generally called samskaras.\n",
            "[10:14.780 --> 10:36.780]  The more we are attentive of the goal and the object of meditation, the more we create room for positive belief systems that, and they in turn, efface imprints that are not in consonance with the goal and create room for new positive and divine-centered beliefs and imprints that we are pregnant with.\n",
            "[10:36.780 --> 10:47.780]  The one imprint that we have inherited from the days when we were descending from the base while passing through the rings of splendor is dependency on Master.\n",
            "[10:47.780 --> 10:51.780]  Such dependency is in fact our real true nature.\n",
            "[10:51.780 --> 10:53.780]  It is our soulmate.\n",
            "[10:53.780 --> 10:58.780]  Dependency precedes consciousness according to some great mystics.\n",
            "[10:58.780 --> 11:03.780]  Without it we are not and without us it is not.\n",
            "[11:03.780 --> 11:21.780]  But before we come to the state of being permanently abiding in the consciousness of dependency, we need to, as pointed out above, get rid of the negative mental and emotional imprints which were also gathered by us in the journey of our individual manifestation.\n",
            "[11:21.780 --> 11:27.780]  The compliance to the commandments of the master enables us to effectively attend to this task.\n",
            "[11:27.780 --> 11:44.780]  More particularly with a clear understanding, without yielding to all sorts of logic for sloth and other intellectual aberrations, we need to learn through implementing the commandments 1, 5, 6, and 7, the attitudes and ability to live in a state of dependency.\n",
            "[11:44.780 --> 11:54.780]  Dependency enables us to live by the principle of letting go, which has been fully explained by the Master in his commentary on the commandment 7.\n",
            "[11:54.780 --> 11:59.780]  The ability to let go complements attentiveness.\n",
            "[11:59.780 --> 12:05.780]  Attentiveness allows us to be aware of our negative thoughts, beliefs and feelings.\n",
            "[12:05.780 --> 12:10.780]  With the awareness and insight, we can then let go of them.\n",
            "[12:10.780 --> 12:21.780]  Since we spend almost every waking hour seeking, acquiring, grasping and clinging on to things, we have the tendency to resist letting go.\n",
            "[12:21.780 --> 12:29.780]  In fact, most people find it extremely difficult to let go of anything, and particularly of feelings and beliefs.\n",
            "[12:29.780 --> 12:35.780]  This is because we have learned to identify our feelings and beliefs as ourselves.\n",
            "[12:35.780 --> 12:38.780]  We think we are feelings and beliefs.\n",
            "[12:38.780 --> 12:49.780]  Thus, we fight and struggle to keep these feelings and beliefs in an effort to preserve ourselves, regardless of whether they are useful or harmful to us.\n",

            "[05:07.480 --> 05:23.080]  However, the place and importance of prayer in Raja Yoga or the method of meditation has to be primarily understood in the context of varied ways of working of buddhi or intellect and manas or feelings.\n",
            "[05:23.080 --> 05:42.280]  It is very clear that in the prayer that Master has given us, what is to be specifically noted and presented before the Master is that we are slaves of our wishes or desires or cravings or urges or aspirations.\n",
            "[05:42.280 --> 05:54.200]  But saying so, we clearly understand and state that we are all the time under the influence of feeling or manas.\n",
            "[05:54.200 --> 06:08.320]  When we apply these terms in the context of our life, we realize that we have not found meaning in our lives and we are running all the time looking for some meaning to our lives.\n",

            "[07:21.620 --> 07:31.120]  The way we get meaning into our life is to develop divine attributes and endeavor to create something that gives us purpose and meaning.\n",
            "[07:31.760 --> 07:36.860]  And this we know is best done by loving Him who loves all.\n",
            "[07:36.860 --> 08:06.300]  This means that we have to overcome the impulsive tendencies in us which are guided and governed by the pleasure principle.\n",

            "[08:26.480 --> 08:47.000]  That is determination, that is determination, is most essential to reach the goal of human life, which by now we all know is happiness to one and all.\n",
            "[08:47.000 --> 08:54.760]  We should remember that determination cannot be got by prayer in the sense of begging.\n",
            "[08:55.960 --> 09:01.260]  Cultivating determination is not a desire and that can be prayed for.\n",
            "[09:02.700 --> 09:05.540]  Desire arises because of attachment.\n",
            "[09:06.540 --> 09:07.820]  Desire has two sides.\n",
            "[09:07.820 --> 09:14.160]  Desire is a craving or wanting to possess, a craving or wanting to possess, and b aversion or wanting to avoid.\n",
            "[09:15.000 --> 09:25.240]  These two sides of desire exemplify the working of the universal law, the law of attraction, along with its implication, the law of repulsion.\n",
            "[09:25.240 --> 09:33.140]  This law is reflected in physics in the statement, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
            "[09:34.200 --> 09:40.540]  We in this land, thanks to the ethics taught to us by the recluses, parading as jnanis,\n",
            "[09:41.100 --> 09:49.360]  got accustomed to consider these two aspects of desire as poisons, and we add a third one too, delusion.\n",
            "[09:49.360 --> 09:54.020]  Delusion is a perception that something is what it is not.\n",
            "[09:55.200 --> 10:00.320]  It is a bias of perception and cognition caused by an afflicted mind and emotion.\n",
            "[10:01.660 --> 10:07.500]  These aspects of desire are movements towards something or away from something.\n",
            "[10:08.260 --> 10:14.760]  They cause pain because we give these desires some of our own thought power,\n",
            "[10:15.240 --> 10:18.940]  though it appears odd and difficult to accept this position.\n",
            "[10:19.360 --> 10:26.900]  During meditation also, these cravings and aversions are the forces that are active,\n",
            "[10:27.620 --> 10:33.880]  and this play on the unregulated mind is generally called disturbance by the aspirants.\n",
            "[10:35.420 --> 10:39.860]  The solution to this problem is detachment from these mental modifications.\n",
            "[10:39.860 --> 10:47.240]  That is why we are advised by the Master to brush off the thoughts of all types as uninvited guests,\n",
            "[10:48.120 --> 10:51.340]  which is the same as total detachment.\n",
            "[10:52.740 --> 10:57.240]  While such total detachment is possible during meditation sessions,\n",
            "[10:57.660 --> 11:02.540]  it is advisable to have due attachment in affairs relating to day-to-day life.\n",
            "[11:02.540 --> 11:07.560]  Dreams and nightmares are our own original versions of reality,\n",
            "[11:08.460 --> 11:11.780]  essentially a creation by our ingenious mind.\n",
            "[11:12.920 --> 11:17.320]  They are part of our personality, and we keep feeding them to stay alive.\n",
            "[11:18.180 --> 11:21.160]  It is usually our desires that feed the dream,\n",
            "[11:21.680 --> 11:24.360]  and our aversions that feed the nightmares.\n",
            "[11:24.360 --> 11:29.740]  During meditation also, this type of dream, like experience,\n",
            "[11:29.880 --> 11:33.080]  occurs even in advanced aspirants in the path.\n",
            "[11:33.900 --> 11:36.980]  Everyone has both negative and positive aspects within,\n",
            "[11:37.660 --> 11:39.580]  as does all manifest reality.\n",

            "[11:47.240 --> 11:49.660]  because then it starts controlling us.\n",
            "[11:49.660 --> 11:54.220]  That is the reason why we are not able to accept negative states of mind\n",

            "[12:03.360 --> 12:08.080]  we crave for the indulgence of the superior person or Master.\n",

            "[12:11.720 --> 12:14.000]  as feeling dependence on Master,\n",

            "[12:25.460 --> 12:28.820]  That is the reason we find many aspirants repeating the words,\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

            "[02:06.140 --> 02:13.140]  There are also mutual conflicts and appreciations and confabulations varying in degree according\n",
            "[02:13.140 --> 02:17.140]  to the level of persons in transaction.\n",
            "[02:17.140 --> 02:23.140]  These persons are never tired of playing and holy is a time when their play reaches a pinnacle\n",
            "[02:23.140 --> 02:25.140]  of excitement.\n",
            "[02:25.140 --> 02:33.140]  We may say it is mostly the Rajasic temperament of a group of persons in full swing.\n",
            "[02:33.140 --> 02:40.140]  Those who do not participate in this merry activity, we may think are detached and sattvic.\n",
            "[02:40.140 --> 02:48.140]  But Master states, these bystanders are also charmed by the colorful form the play offers.\n",
            "[02:48.140 --> 02:56.140]  Perhaps they engage in the play in a vicarious manner and the play is enjoyed in the mental sphere\n",
            "[02:56.140 --> 03:01.140]  as contrasted to the physical plane in which it is played.\n",
            "[03:01.140 --> 03:07.140]  It is similar to the viewers of TV or those who are in the stands of cricket stadium watching\n",
            "[03:07.140 --> 03:09.140]  the game.\n",
            "[03:09.140 --> 03:15.140]  Undoubtedly these persons are very much involved and excited in the game even as the actual players.\n",
            "[03:15.140 --> 03:24.140]  We are having amongst us persons who belong to the playful temperament and the so called\n",
            "[03:24.140 --> 03:27.140]  involved or detached observers.\n",
            "[03:27.140 --> 03:32.140]  That speaks of their viveka and the level of their frivolous activities.\n",
            "[03:32.140 --> 03:42.140]  But all these activities are colored and they may be orange, yellow, blue, black, etc.\n",
            "[03:42.140 --> 03:47.140]  So long as a person has not moved out of the Pindadesh, that person will play these colors\n",
            "[03:47.140 --> 03:49.140]  and colorful activities.\n",
            "[03:49.140 --> 03:55.140]  It is to be noted that the mind along with the faculties of perception are involved in\n",
            "[03:55.140 --> 03:56.140]  these activities.\n",
            "[03:56.140 --> 04:02.140]  Master states that as long as the eyes bear the power of distinction between black, yellow,\n",
            "[04:02.140 --> 04:04.140]  blue colors, etc.\n",
            "[04:04.140 --> 04:15.140]  which is the real aspect of the color, it cannot be called to have discrimination or real knowledge\n",
            "[04:15.140 --> 04:16.140]  of our colors.\n",
            "[04:16.140 --> 04:22.140]  This we know as a discrepancy of perception.\n",
            "[04:22.140 --> 04:29.140]  So long as there is a variety in inclination, one does not give due respect to color.\n",
            "[04:29.140 --> 04:34.140]  Rabbi Babaji raises a question here saying, am I able to comprehend as to whether the holy\n",
            "[04:34.140 --> 04:40.140]  comes to get the colors distinguished or is it the manifestation of his craftsmanship?\n",
            "[04:40.140 --> 04:47.140]  And he says to the Abhyasi, to whom this letter was sent, you may decide it yourself.\n",
            "[04:47.140 --> 04:53.140]  The point is, are we celebrating the beauty of the craftsmanship of God or just engaged\n",
            "[04:53.140 --> 04:59.140]  in silly color mudslinging at each other?\n",
            "[04:59.140 --> 05:05.140]  Master in the message given on the centenary celebrations of Rabbi Lalaji Maharaj says that\n",
            "[05:05.140 --> 05:12.140]  purity starts from being and impurities are the result of wrong suggestions and improper utilization\n",
            "[05:12.140 --> 05:14.140]  of the inner environment.\n",
            "[05:14.140 --> 05:21.140]  When all these are combined, a narrowness of view is affected and this is one of the factors\n",
            "[05:21.140 --> 05:27.140]  for creating a sort of confusion, sometimes automatically and sometimes forced by circumstances.\n",
            "[05:27.140 --> 05:31.140]  When all these things are accumulated, they bring different colors.\n",
            "[05:31.140 --> 05:37.140]  This affects the lower part of the mind which gives direction to the higher part.\n",
            "[05:37.140 --> 05:40.140]  Now your direction is not correct.\n",
            "[05:40.140 --> 05:47.140]  When we contemplate on these lines, we understand how we see things in our own choice of colors.\n",
            "[05:47.140 --> 05:51.140]  Every one of us has his own pair of colored glasses.\n",
            "[05:51.140 --> 05:56.140]  It is only when we can control and moderate the impulses of the lower mind,\n",
            "[05:56.140 --> 06:01.140]  we can be said to have moved out of the range of the pair of glasses, prejudices.\n",
            "[06:01.140 --> 06:09.140]  The task requires, as we all know, our individual efforts and the influence of pranaguti received from the trainer.\n",
            "[06:09.140 --> 06:15.140]  Master states that whether I be standing, sitting, lying down or in a pose whatsoever,\n",
            "[06:15.140 --> 06:18.140]  I am always at the same point with this.\n",
            "[06:18.140 --> 06:25.140]  He therefore suggests that while one may be engaged in the festivities, one should be in touch with the base.\n",
            "[06:25.140 --> 06:31.140]  He says that means the base of the destination must never go out of our mind.\n",
            "[06:31.140 --> 06:34.140]  We must ever keep our base in mind.\n",
            "[06:34.140 --> 06:40.140]  The destination can only be arrived at by him who has become crazy and mad after it.\n",
            "[06:40.140 --> 06:43.140]  I do not find any other method better than this.\n",
            "[06:43.140 --> 06:48.140]  Whoever has made progress in this field has adopted this very pose.\n",
            "[06:48.140 --> 06:57.140]  Whoever becomes mad at someone, then it is just not possible that the latter's madness may not make him, the former, restless.\n",
            "[06:57.140 --> 07:01.140]  When pain is there, the cure would also come.\n",
            "[07:01.140 --> 07:03.140]  We have to create pain in our heart.\n",
            "[07:03.140 --> 07:10.140]  If someone asks me, I would say that all the labour, practices and abhyas is aimed at this only.\n",
            "[07:10.140 --> 07:15.140]  Will that time come when I will also be able to see such burning hearts?\n",
            "[07:15.140 --> 07:26.140]  Definitely, it must come when you develop feelings like mine, that is when you become eagerly impatient to acquire all those states which I am restless to impart now.\n",
            "[07:26.140 --> 07:45.140]  I am very sure that many amongst us here in this august gathering have been restless to acquire higher states of consciousness and continue to acquire still higher states and moving nearer to the never ending state of negation, even as a seeker to whom this letter was addressed by the master.\n",
            "[07:45.140 --> 07:56.140]  For the question as to how one should be in the realm of colours, he said, his brief reply to it would be that one must become colourless while playing with colours.\n",
            "[07:56.140 --> 08:02.140]  We know that the realm of Pindadesha is that of colours and that of the regions beyond its colourlessness.\n",
            "[08:02.140 --> 08:06.140]  Holy is the festival of colours and is connected with Lord Krishna.\n",
            "[08:06.140 --> 08:11.140]  The Lord is supposed to have participated in that festival with gusto.\n",
            "[08:11.140 --> 08:14.140]  Colourfulness is a product of our mind.\n",
            "[08:14.140 --> 08:27.140]  Master states that the simple unassuming character of mind has changed in the march of times and has assumed a colourful disposition and began to shed its effect on everything in us, both outer and inner.\n",
            "[08:27.140 --> 08:33.140]  Whatever therefore we take into thought or action exhibits colourfulness in all its phases.\n",
            "[08:33.140 --> 08:42.140]  However, we know that we are all involved in the process of developing the unity of perception and living according to the principles of the natural path.\n",
            "[08:42.140 --> 08:58.140]  Master states that the most peculiar feature of our society is that when it is in full bloom, it is all covered over with a desolateness which further on gets transformed into wilderness.\n",
            "[08:58.140 --> 09:03.140]  For this reason, it is devoid of any charm or attraction.\n",
            "[09:03.140 --> 09:08.140]  If I describe it as something pleasant and willing, it will then be a testless one.\n",
            "[09:08.140 --> 09:17.140]  How can a professional seeker of eternal bliss, Paramananda, who is addicted to colouration, at each step be attracted towards it?\n",
            "[09:17.140 --> 09:27.140]  This condition can be appreciated only by one who, having gone mad with love, wanders about wailing and crying for what he knows not.\n",
            "[09:27.140 --> 09:34.140]  In such a state, one would be feeling the same condition even though he happened to be amidst festivities and revelries.\n",
            "[09:34.140 --> 09:44.140]  As for myself, wherever I happen to be, the entire surroundings there are covered over with an air of desolation on account of my presence there.\n",
            "[09:44.140 --> 09:52.140]  A humorist might well interpret it in funny ways, but perhaps that alone can be the most appropriate description of my condition.\n",
            "[09:52.140 --> 09:58.140]  Really, the thing at the root gets exposed when the colourful disposition of the mind is transformed.\n",
            "[09:58.140 --> 10:04.140]  When the material world is out of view, the thought naturally settles down on the other one.\n",
            "[10:04.140 --> 10:14.140]  But this colourness of mind may not be much appreciable to most people except to those who have become accustomed to it through constant association.\n",
            "[10:15.140 --> 10:22.140]  Should we therefore take for granted to have such a condition because of our alleged association with him?\n",
            "[10:22.140 --> 10:37.140]  Because we coo his name very often and more particularly when we see his photographs, it is obvious that constant association with him would be possible and true to those who have gone beyond the Pindadish.\n",
            "[10:37.140 --> 10:49.140]  And when we go on and on through different conditions, casting off four assumed colouring till finally we become quite colourless.\n",
            "[10:49.140 --> 10:56.140]  You should be remembered of the four colours of the first four cards is what is mentioned here by the Master.\n",
            "[10:56.140 --> 10:58.140]  Master further states,\n",
            "[10:58.140 --> 11:06.140]  Now if somehow I too get affected by the colours of the holy, then my reply to it would be path pheasant and path patridge,\n",
            "[11:06.140 --> 11:10.140]  a mixture of coherence and incoherence like that of a drunkard.\n",
            "[11:10.140 --> 11:17.140]  If we have linked ourselves to the whole, then certainly the same view should appear before our vision.\n",
            "[11:17.140 --> 11:28.140]  It therefore follows that if we get ourselves linked to the ultimate, then the colour of the same ultimate shall peripasso prevail in us.\n",
            "[11:28.140 --> 11:39.140]  And if perchance we become unaware of that link by maintaining it repeatedly, then please tell me what would be your forum or share thereafter.\n",
            "[11:39.140 --> 11:43.140]  The same state of emergence which we are in search of.\n",
            "[11:43.140 --> 11:47.140]  What a good thing it would be if we learn this lesson from Holi.\n",
            "[11:47.140 --> 11:52.140]  It may be mentioned that there is a story relating to the festival Holi.\n",
            "[11:52.140 --> 11:57.140]  It appears that the legendary Hiranyakasapu had a sister by name Holika.\n",
            "[11:57.140 --> 12:02.140]  She has a siddhi by which she can sit on the fire and remain unburnt.\n",
            "[12:02.140 --> 12:17.140]  As a part of the various tactics used by the Asura to kill his son Prahlada, he asked his sister to hold his son on her lap and sit on fire hoping that his son will get burned and there will be no damage to his sister.\n",
            "[12:17.140 --> 12:21.140]  But Prahlada survived and Holika got burnt.\n",
            "[12:21.140 --> 12:28.140]  The festival is celebrated to reassure that one who has surrendered cannot be destroyed by australic persons like Holika.\n",
            "[12:28.140 --> 12:38.140]  It may be seen here that the element of fire which refers to the third knot and control over that is a siddhi due to devotion can be burnt.\n",
            "[12:38.140 --> 12:48.140]  But the one who has surrendered to the divine, that is a person establishing the fourth knot, will survive the element of fire and move on to the realm of air.\n",
            "[12:48.140 --> 13:00.140]  The value of a diamond is well known and justly we from Andhra Pradesh can take pride in stating that Golkonda is the place where we have found the first big diamond.\n",
            "[13:00.140 --> 13:07.140]  We all know that it is not the colour of the diamond that grants its value but its colourlessness.\n",
            "[13:07.140 --> 13:20.140]  In fact grading colour, in fact grading colour in the normal range involves deciding how closely a stone's body colour approaches colourlessness.\n",
            "[13:20.140 --> 13:27.140]  A diamond can divide light into a spectrum of colours and reflect this light as colourful flashes called fire.\n",
            "[13:27.140 --> 13:40.140]  It is persons who have entrenched deeply in the super-consciousness of the highest variety that emit or fire colours according to the need of the aspirants in their system in the centres related to the various colours.\n",
            "[13:40.140 --> 13:54.140]  It may be said, even as the colourlessness of the diamond gives rise to the range of colours, the non-consciousness grants various shades of consciousness and colours in our march to infinity.\n",
            "[13:54.140 --> 13:57.140]  Colours play extraordinary tricks on the mind.\n",
            "[13:57.140 --> 13:58.140]  Colours play extraordinary tricks on the mind.\n",
            "[13:58.140 --> 14:03.140]  Play with the colours in the context of spirituality is bound to be an interesting study by itself.\n",
            "[14:03.140 --> 14:07.140]  Black is associated with Sufis and Goddess Kali.\n",
            "[14:07.140 --> 14:10.140]  Orange with seal sadhus and sanyasis.\n",
            "[14:10.140 --> 14:14.140]  White with Jains, nuns and Christian preachers.\n",
            "[14:14.140 --> 14:17.140]  Yellow with robes of Lord Krishna himself.\n",
            "[14:17.140 --> 14:19.140]  Ash with Lord Shiva.\n",
            "[14:19.140 --> 14:21.140]  Blue with Mahavishnu and so on.\n",
            "[14:21.140 --> 14:30.140]  This should be enough indication for those who seek colourlessness to avoid the association of these men and demigods and gods.\n",
            "[14:30.140 --> 14:36.140]  It is obvious that the polar opposite of positive mystical colour imagery is colourlessness.\n",
            "[14:36.140 --> 14:41.140]  Colour is the characteristic of the individual, while colourlessness is the characteristic of the universal.\n",
            "[14:41.140 --> 14:43.140]  This is obvious for us.\n",
            "[14:43.140 --> 14:48.140]  As we transcend the realm of Pinnidesh, we enter into the realms of colourlessness.\n",
            "[14:48.140 --> 14:55.140]  In those certain times, the individuality of the sadhaka persists and we have visions coloured with pink or ruby.\n",
            "[14:55.140 --> 15:08.140]  We find that human civilization has always programmed happiness through sexual freedom and drugs and drinks, including the Vedic Soma, which are supposed to create feelings of euphoria.\n",
            "[15:08.140 --> 15:17.140]  Scent and colour objects and music provide momentary pictures on our mind, exciting virtual and unreal and imaginary visions.\n",
            "[15:17.140 --> 15:30.140]  That is the reason why many persons indulge in colours, selection of garments is a classic example where those who are interested in colours indulge in excitement and never end that game.\n",
            "[15:30.140 --> 15:40.140]  That is perhaps the reason why those who are seeking colourlessness issue bright primary colour imagery in favour of dull hues which border on colourlessness.\n",
            "[15:40.140 --> 15:49.140]  It is because of this criteria of colourlessness of the spiritual plane, application of religious thought in this plane becomes virtually impossible.\n",
            "[15:49.140 --> 15:59.140]  Spiritual societies therefore forbid noise, including that of music, as the members seek silence. Silence is the auditory version of colourlessness.\n",
            "[15:59.140 --> 16:14.140]  We may recall that Master forbade all music during celebrations except at the end the recital of Marifat, a song in praise of Rabbi Lalaji Maharaj for having given as a Master who is a personification of love.\n",
            "[16:14.140 --> 16:20.140]  He is silence which is always emitting the colourlessness of spiritual presence.\n",
            "[16:20.140 --> 16:26.140]  Anyone who tries to get into such a state of silence all on his own will never find the way towards that.\n",
            "[16:26.140 --> 16:41.140]  The aspirant has to learn that he or she has to put a full stop to the conceptual thinking to which one is accustomed to and it is then the Master appears in the scene, his presence being felt as eloquent silence.\n",
            "[16:41.140 --> 16:51.140]  That is a state when the consciousness pure and simple reigns as we all know during the deep states of meditation when neither we nor he is there.\n",
            "[16:51.140 --> 17:02.140]  That is Sri Ramchandra consciousness. It is then whether it is our state or his state does not matter and it is all the same and that is laya or marjas.\n",
            "[17:02.140 --> 17:18.140]  It is when we are inspired by the great purpose of the Master who is labouring hard to bring in transformation of the human nature and partake in that extraordinary project, all our personal and selfish and self-centred thoughts break their bounds.\n",
            "[17:18.140 --> 17:29.140]  Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and we discover ourselves to be a greater person by far than we ever dreamed ourselves to be.\n",
            "[17:29.140 --> 17:42.140]  It is true, even then adverse circumstances test our courage, our strength of mind and the depth of our conviction in the Dharma propounded by the great Master Sri Ramchandra Ji Maharaj of Shajampur, India.\n",
            "[17:42.140 --> 17:49.140]  There is nothing exceptional about practicing this path of Dharma in a good environment and atmosphere.\n",
            "[17:49.140 --> 17:58.140]  The true test is if we can maintain our practice in adverse conditions. That is possible when we are totally colourless in an otherwise colourful atmosphere.\n",
            "[17:58.140 --> 18:04.140]  Being colourless when we remain firmly committed to the faultless path of the Master.\n",

            "[03:45.300 --> 03:52.500]  Yet we have no idea what each of us is thinking and what we really want.\n",
            "[03:52.500 --> 03:58.780]  Perhaps in this very minute we are thinking about someone living in a different place or even\n",
            "[03:58.780 --> 04:01.820]  at a different time.\n",
            "[04:01.820 --> 04:05.220]  We all say we love the Master.\n",
            "[04:05.220 --> 04:12.780]  It is for certain that we all know that people in love are the most boring people to talk to.\n",
            "[04:12.780 --> 04:26.100]  They may be standing right in front of us, but their minds are constantly on the charming, lovely, wonderful, smart, loved one.\n",
            "[04:26.100 --> 04:36.060]  We should all naturally agree that this should be our state of mind if we really mean our love to our Master.\n",
            "[04:36.060 --> 04:43.380]  Whether it is so, let the lovers of the Master answer for themselves.\n",
            "[04:43.380 --> 04:52.740]  Further we say, we love each other dearly as all of us are dearly seeking the same Master.\n",
            "[04:52.740 --> 05:04.060]  Yet, if we are asked as to who was sitting by our side during the meditation, it is doubtful whether we would come forward to answer.\n",
            "[05:04.060 --> 05:11.380]  If there were to be an answer, it is obvious that the object of love was not the one.\n",
            "[05:11.380 --> 05:25.380]  But we know, there are lovers of the Master who say that the meditation was affected because of the person who was before him throwing out the entire person's dirt on them.\n",
            "[05:25.380 --> 05:35.340]  Therefore, so many other judgments of others are made by these types of persons, and the veil, their love of the Master could not be expressed fully.\n",
            "[05:35.340 --> 05:46.480]  But it must be clearly understood that during our deep emergence in the thought or consciousness of our beloved Master, we recognize none but him.\n",
            "[05:47.440 --> 05:56.260]  It is thus clear that we think, feel and imagine what we feel close to and what we really want.\n",
            "[05:56.260 --> 06:11.840]  It is obvious that we can only detect what our senses can perceive.\n",
            "[06:11.840 --> 06:20.380]  The eye, for example, can perceive images by receiving specific wavelengths between the colors purple and red.\n",
            "[06:21.840 --> 06:28.860]  That is why we cannot see shorter wavelengths than purple, such as ultraviolet, with the naked eye.\n",
            "[06:30.040 --> 06:32.940]  A bee, on the other hand, does see ultraviolet.\n",
            "[06:32.940 --> 06:42.000]  And this enables it to detect different kinds of flowers that we humans would not be able to distinguish.\n",
            "[06:43.420 --> 06:54.640]  We all know that our world contains many frequencies, most of which we cannot receive, although they do affect us, like the radio or X-ray waves.\n",
            "[06:54.640 --> 07:08.160]  But the right instrument that can translate these waves to a length, our sense organs can perceive, we will be able to detect those waves in the space around us.\n",
            "[07:08.160 --> 07:25.060]  If we are asked, what is being broadcast right now, on our favorite radio station, we would most likely say that we do not know.\n",
            "[07:26.020 --> 07:32.380]  But if we turn on the radio and switch to the frequency of our favorite station, we would immediately answer.\n",
            "[07:32.380 --> 07:40.860]  This is due to the fact that the radio fixes itself to work on a frequency that existed in the air before we turned it on.\n",
            "[07:41.500 --> 07:49.040]  It helps us transform the message created in the radio station from an undetectable wavelength to one our ears can detect.\n",
            "[07:49.960 --> 07:53.480]  The law of equivalence of form works in the spiritual world also.\n",
            "[07:53.840 --> 08:01.240]  But in spirituality, it is all about similarity and dissimilarity of intentions.\n",
            "[08:02.380 --> 08:05.240]  Not about equivalence of frequencies.\n",
            "[08:06.060 --> 08:09.780]  All that is measured in the spiritual world are intentional thoughts.\n",
            "[08:10.940 --> 08:19.740]  The intention of the pranasya pranaha that governs the whole reality, including our lives, is only to bestow, to give.\n",
            "[08:20.780 --> 08:21.860]  It acts out of love.\n",
            "[08:22.700 --> 08:29.340]  If we want to know and understand how the world is ruled, we should also acquire the intention to bestow.\n",
            "[08:29.340 --> 08:41.320]  If we concentrate on ourselves and on our personal benefit, we will not know the reasons for everything that happens around and within us,\n",
            "[08:41.320 --> 08:59.540]  since we remain detached from the superior force of pranasya pranaha.\n",
            "[08:59.540 --> 09:12.200]  It is only when our consciousness equalizes with the divine, we discover the true nature of all things and how all are intertwined and in the process find happiness and peace.\n",
            "[09:13.560 --> 09:18.020]  No one other than the master has stated this principle of equivalence better.\n",
            "[09:18.020 --> 09:26.700]  By being in complete oneness with the master, it follows that if master is merciful, we should become merciful.\n",
            "[09:27.420 --> 09:30.860]  As he is called gracious, we are also to be gracious.\n",
            "[09:31.620 --> 09:34.480]  As he is called holy, we too shall be holy.\n",
            "[09:34.480 --> 09:41.820]  The importance of complying with the Ten Commandments of the Master can be easily understood when we know these implications.\n",
            "[09:42.700 --> 09:51.960]  We then shall become personifications of forbearing, compassionate, righteous and all such good, noble and godly qualities.\n",
            "[09:52.740 --> 10:01.140]  Oneness with the Master or God shall lie in conducting ourselves in such a way to resemble him as much as one can.\n",
            "[10:01.140 --> 10:07.740]  I request all to study in depth the lives of the masters and educate the children in this regard.\n",
            "[10:08.500 --> 10:12.160]  That is our duty and should be our way of loving the master.\n",
            "[10:12.860 --> 10:15.380]  Master said, love him who loves all.\n",
            "[10:16.000 --> 10:21.240]  I would prefer to appeal, live in such a manner that he would live in us.\n",
            "[10:22.420 --> 10:28.660]  It is a great pleasure to be with the persons who love the master, heart, mind and soul.\n",
            "[10:31.140 --> 10:45.180]  Surely amongst us, there are persons who have, if I can use the phrase, perfected their insignificance to merit being with the master always.\n",
            "[10:47.980 --> 10:50.140]  All are in fact with him, alone.\n",
            "[10:50.140 --> 11:04.840]  All are in fact with him, alone.\n",
            "[11:06.580 --> 11:10.800]  But there are some who are not seen as different from the master.\n",
            "[11:11.920 --> 11:16.860]  Traveling together for a period of four decades has a sentiment of its own.\n",
            "[11:16.860 --> 11:21.620]  Such a sentiment carries along with it the scent of the divine.\n",
            "[11:22.720 --> 11:29.320]  My being swells in joy and freedom to be deserving such a company and it is all his play.\n",
            "[11:30.340 --> 11:34.160]  Cost and remembrance is a means and is also the end.\n",
            "[11:34.960 --> 11:40.940]  That is the beginning of sadhana and that is also the nature of the first ring of splendor.\n",
            "[11:40.940 --> 11:46.360]  We live in such a state now and let us continue to live in that state.\n",

            "[02:16.300 --> 02:29.840]  When they were told to suppress an emotion, emotional reaction to a movie, they had problems solving a solvable anagram.\n",
            "[02:29.840 --> 02:43.740]  It is concluded in the study that this is the overwhelming reason why willpower works only in the short term.\n",
            "[02:43.740 --> 02:57.560]  We only have the conscious resources to exhibit willpower on one or at the most two fronts at a time.\n",
            "[03:00.560 --> 03:02.120]  Conscious resources.\n",
            "[03:03.040 --> 03:03.740]  Can we note that?\n",
            "[03:03.740 --> 03:13.480]  This is why it is so hard to stay disciplined with eating, exercise, studying and the like.\n",
            "[03:15.260 --> 03:26.160]  Any self-regulatory strategy has cost with respect to depleting a person's general resources for self-regulation.\n",
            "[03:26.160 --> 03:38.180]  It is obvious that this is the problem we have to remain in the thought of the Master throughout despite our will to do so.\n",
            "[03:38.180 --> 03:54.540]  It is also observed in certain studies on the functioning of the mind that our conscious mind is only able to process approximately 50 bits of information a second,\n",
            "[03:55.200 --> 04:01.880]  while our unconscious mind processes approximately 11 million bits per second.\n",
            "[04:01.880 --> 04:13.360]  That means our unconscious mind processes information about 220,000 times faster than our conscious mind.\n",
            "[04:15.560 --> 04:21.620]  Thus, our conscious mind is actually the bottleneck in effecting true change.\n",
            "[04:23.240 --> 04:31.120]  As its main role is getting us through the present, here and now.\n",
            "[04:31.880 --> 04:46.120]  This fact is what Master stressed when he instructed us to give a suggestion before and due to meditation and also prayer and allow that to work in the subconscious.\n",
            "[04:47.960 --> 04:56.800]  Therefore, we have to use the switches residing in the unconscious or subconscious to bring desired behavioral patterns.\n",
            "[04:56.800 --> 05:14.360]  For example, if our goal is weight control, we would naturally want our unconscious mind to automatically desire healthy green foods, water, healthy tonics, exercise, etc., without having to think about it consciously.\n",
            "[05:14.360 --> 05:35.620]  Or if our goal used to be more productive, we would want the actions of setting goals, rewarding ourselves for success, focusing on our projects to be automatic.\n",
            "[05:35.620 --> 05:44.100]  It is obvious that if we have to consciously think about it all the time, we will exhaust our resources.\n",
            "[05:45.620 --> 05:50.740]  These are just a few examples to make the point clear.\n",
            "[05:50.740 --> 05:58.120]  Similarly, we have to allow the subconscious to continuously work towards our goal.\n",
            "[05:58.900 --> 06:11.360]  This is the logic used by the Master when he asked us to offer prayer before going to bed and he did clarify that the prayer will be running through the night in the subconscious plane.\n",
            "[06:11.360 --> 06:19.780]  A sincere prayer offered before going to bed enables us to get up with the thought of the Master when we wake up.\n",
            "[06:20.660 --> 06:22.760]  This we all experience every day.\n",
            "[06:23.760 --> 06:38.040]  This is one of the reasons why if we follow the Master's instruction to just give a suggestion, be it a meditation or prayer, and allow that to work in the subconscious or unconscious plane, we find the results are very good.\n",
            "[06:38.040 --> 06:51.320]  On the contrary, if we try to consciously apply our mental resources to be in a condition of what we would like to call focused, we tend to get into mental strain and confusion.\n",
            "[06:53.120 --> 07:03.840]  In the MRI studies, which I am not able to fully recall, conducted at the University of Iowa, they could actually see the brain following instructions and their suggestions.\n",
            "[07:03.840 --> 07:14.600]  People are actually shutting off the feelings of pain and they could see the pain gateways in the brain being blocked under strong suggestions.\n",
            "[07:14.600 --> 07:29.000]  I am not trying to find any justification for the process given by the Master, as no such thing is necessary, but would like my associates to know that thought given a suggestion works.\n",
            "[07:29.000 --> 07:39.220]  It is our experience that the suggestions which are not vocalized and are penetrated into the hearts of the aspirants have worked wonders in many cases.\n",
            "[07:40.140 --> 07:51.520]  It is also our experience that when the aspirants, instead of being receptive to the Pranahuti, entertain their own thoughts during individual sittings, they really do not derive much benefit.\n",
            "[07:51.520 --> 08:05.080]  During meditational exercises of pain, it is absolutely necessary that we live in an attitude of yielding and do not use our mental, vital and physical resources to improve the quality of meditation.\n",
            "[08:05.080 --> 08:27.540]  Sincerity is a tough characteristic to understand, develop and maintain, and this applies also to our efforts to meditate and follow the instructions of the Master in all sincerity.\n",
            "[08:27.540 --> 08:39.820]  There is no doubt that all of us are sincere and all of us desire to work for the Master, but more often, a person's sincerity is taken for granted.\n",
            "[08:39.820 --> 08:49.860]  It is likely that we define the word sincerity to mean, without hypocrisy or pretence, not fiend and true.\n",
            "[08:50.760 --> 08:58.860]  Sincerity is essential for anyone interested in ending misery in any walk of life and who in truth wants freedom.\n",
            "[08:58.860 --> 09:10.300]  It is necessary to note that sincerity has nothing to do with sentiment, commitment, religion, spiritual practice or well-meaning.\n",
            "[09:11.580 --> 09:16.100]  Sincerity is not possible without questioning belief.\n",
            "[09:18.380 --> 09:25.460]  Such questioning is sometimes called skepticism, but it is possible to be skeptical without being sincere.\n",
            "[09:25.460 --> 09:37.240]  One can proclaim a doubt about anything, even against weighty evidence, and spin sophisticated arguments, but that leads to endless argumentation.\n",
            "[09:38.040 --> 09:40.960]  Doubt is a means to understanding, not an end.\n",
            "[09:42.160 --> 09:52.080]  When we consider the doubt about the first successful effort to claim the Mount Everest, we thought it to be a hoax, because it had never been achieved before.\n",
            "[09:52.080 --> 10:02.060]  When Master said that now the entry into central region is possible, we doubted it, as no such thing has ever happened earlier.\n",
            "[10:03.180 --> 10:10.060]  The point of doubt is not to doubt, but it is a means adopter to rid oneself of errors.\n",
            "[10:10.060 --> 10:17.880]  A person cannot be sincere without skepticism, for a sincere person is not interested in winning.\n",
            "[10:18.640 --> 10:24.540]  The person is only interested in freeing himself from error and finally seek truth or freedom.\n",
            "[10:25.360 --> 10:30.560]  In the spiritual path, sincerity is a tool that we can ill afford to ignore.\n",
            "[10:30.560 --> 10:35.640]  I have dilated a bit on the too obvious.\n",
            "[10:36.740 --> 10:37.480]  I have a reason.\n",
            "[10:38.220 --> 10:47.440]  During meditation or contemplation, several flashes of light or melodious tunes or a feeling of eureka does happen to many aspirants.\n",
            "[10:48.380 --> 10:51.000]  To accept them without doubt is naive.\n",
            "[10:51.900 --> 10:54.060]  To deny them is ignorance.\n",
            "[10:54.060 --> 10:59.500]  The borderline between genuine and faked experience is very thin.\n",
            "[11:00.400 --> 11:08.880]  It is here we need to have some awareness of the various conditions as imperienced by the foreigners in the path.\n",
            "[11:10.060 --> 11:14.920]  ISRC has endeavored its bid to provide such information.\n",
            "[11:15.920 --> 11:22.800]  Imperiences of the divine path are as numerous and varied as the stars and stellar constellations.\n",
            "[11:24.060 --> 11:29.540]  While some spiritual traditions called some formation as seven sages or sattva rishis,\n",
            "[11:30.020 --> 11:33.580]  some others called the same formation as ursa major.\n",
            "[11:34.240 --> 11:43.300]  In the same manner, spiritual conditions which are essentially the same are given different names and descriptions in several traditions.\n",
            "[11:44.400 --> 11:48.800]  Doubt is related to the problem of instruments of observation and knowing.\n",
            "[11:48.800 --> 11:55.900]  The problem is complicated when we accept certain means of knowing like Aptavachana and Shruti.\n",
            "[11:56.780 --> 12:01.260]  I do not want to talk about this problem as it was dealt with on earlier occasions.\n",
            "[12:02.520 --> 12:11.400]  The freedom from errors of observation and feelings and ideas which is in fact one of our main goals is not a matter to be taken for granted.\n",
            "[12:11.400 --> 12:15.520]  The question is always sincere to get rid of these.\n",
            "[12:16.500 --> 12:20.160]  Agreeably, people wish to be free of troubling pains.\n",
            "[12:21.360 --> 12:27.580]  But it is not all that show that they would like to get rid of their erroneous beliefs and habits.\n",
            "[12:27.580 --> 12:38.420]  I personally know many who stick to odd notions of worship and practice rituals and unverified beliefs and above authority\n",
            "[12:38.420 --> 12:46.220]  willingly maintain erroneous beliefs and habits because they are consoling and comforting them.\n",
            "[12:47.620 --> 12:49.200]  Can we call this sincerity?\n",
            "[12:49.200 --> 12:58.000]  This is similar to a politician who uses truth when it is to his advantage but discords it when it is inconvenient.\n",
            "[12:58.900 --> 13:11.580]  It is also like a friend who professes never to lie to his or her friend but neglects to speak things that would be difficult for his or her friend to hear.\n",
            "[13:11.580 --> 13:26.120]  This is usually rationalized as caring for the feelings of others involved when in fact usually it is a manipulation and self-centered fear.\n",
            "[13:27.580 --> 13:37.160]  However, if the truth is expressed plainly, it would put the others in a position to make informed decisions about their relationship.\n",
            "[13:37.160 --> 13:44.260]  If we will tell a friend something that we will not tell our mother, then our mother is not our friend.\n",
            "[13:46.640 --> 13:57.780]  It should be obvious to any sincere person that any union or yoga or relationship is not loving if we have to abandon truth to maintain the union.\n",
            "[13:57.780 --> 14:07.560]  Unfortunately, with many aspirants, this is the malady as they tend to ride more than one horse at a time.\n",
            "[14:09.620 --> 14:14.520]  It is perhaps true that sincerity is not as common as we believe.\n",
            "[14:15.340 --> 14:16.460]  It is in fact rare.\n",
            "[14:17.340 --> 14:27.560]  Many wish to persist in thinking that they are sincere, refusing to acknowledge the error because it is comfortable or suggestive of egoistic fulfillment.\n",
            "[14:27.780 --> 14:35.540]  We have noticed that herds of people are seduced by pretence, particularly when it is sophisticated.\n",
            "[14:36.140 --> 14:41.020]  Our babas, masters, guides and gurus are aesthetically pleasing.\n",
            "[14:41.580 --> 14:47.120]  Our utsavams and brahmasavams etc. to their beliefs, expectations and conditioned habits.\n",
            "[14:48.440 --> 14:55.580]  Some of us think that intellect, intelligence and education may be the antidote for credulity.\n",
            "[14:55.580 --> 14:59.920]  But history does not seem to warrant such a conclusion.\n",
            "[15:00.840 --> 15:08.860]  Wise men have often said that learning and judgment are often not granted in equal measure.\n",
            "[15:10.540 --> 15:14.540]  Political and social pretence have been a cause of much suffering.\n",
            "[15:15.300 --> 15:21.880]  And some of the most common vectors for contagious pretence are religion, dogma and creeds.\n",
            "[15:21.880 --> 15:32.960]  Some of the greatest remains responsible for the most advanced breakthroughs in science have been people who have accepted untested religious ideas and beliefs.\n",
            "[15:33.780 --> 15:41.320]  Their sincerity and skepticism were only fragmentary and were fixated in their areas of expertise.\n",
            "[15:41.320 --> 15:49.060]  To err is human, but to invite and persist in error through pretence is delusion.\n",
            "[15:50.240 --> 15:54.020]  Delusion has nothing to do with intelligence or the lack thereof.\n",
            "[15:54.020 --> 16:08.000]  Delusion is not about making a mistake, being limited or not knowing anything in particular as all these require no effort.\n",
            "[16:09.100 --> 16:19.380]  However, it takes effort to alter reality in the mind with pretence, prejudice and beliefs and hence to delude oneself.\n",
            "[16:19.380 --> 16:26.660]  The motive to delude oneself is to sustain and console an ego that otherwise would be exposed.\n",
            "[16:27.600 --> 16:35.080]  It should be obvious that we cannot entertain or invoke in us delusion and sincerity at the same time.\n",
            "[16:36.040 --> 16:40.640]  They are contradictory and we need to reject all delusions to know the truth.\n",
            "[16:40.640 --> 16:46.100]  This vairagya is fundamental to any significant growth in spirituality.\n",
            "[16:47.100 --> 16:51.980]  It is held by some English writer that there are four causes of ignorance.\n",
            "[16:51.980 --> 17:02.460]  One, to follow the example of weak and undeserving authorities.\n",
            "[17:03.160 --> 17:07.980]  Two, the influence of custom without proper verification.\n",
            "[17:09.380 --> 17:12.280]  Three, the opinion of the unlearned crowd.\n",
            "[17:13.680 --> 17:19.320]  Four, the concealment of one's ignorance in a display of apparent wisdom.\n",
            "[17:19.320 --> 17:29.300]  These same four causes or plagues of ignorance may well be taken to be the causes of enormous egoism.\n",
            "[17:30.720 --> 17:39.400]  Significantly, it is the fourth one listed above which is the worst as it is the springboard from which all human evils emerge.\n",
            "[17:39.400 --> 17:47.080]  It is obvious that one cannot be sincere and at the same time indulge in habits listed above.\n",
            "[17:47.900 --> 18:00.040]  Some may try to indulge in this double riding as they sincerely believe in such aforementioned authorities, customs, opinions and one's own display of wisdom.\n",
            "[18:00.040 --> 18:09.980]  For any rational mind, it is clear that while clinging to the previously listed habits, there is no way out of error and consequent ignorance.\n",
            "[18:10.820 --> 18:21.700]  Such a position brings to our mind the words ignorance, arrogance and indolence and do not suggest even remotely ideas descriptive of sincerity.\n",
            "[18:21.700 --> 18:37.320]  I do get many ways in which the aspirants confess that they are trying to be sincere in their efforts to do the sadhana as prescribed by the master and also are trying very sincerely to follow the commandments of the master.\n",
            "[18:37.320 --> 18:46.780]  I may be pardoned when I clarify that trying to be sincere as an idea as an idea is a camouflage for insincidity.\n",
            "[18:48.100 --> 18:53.080]  It is an opposition to our will and as such is dualistic.\n",
            "[18:54.320 --> 19:00.020]  The inevitable dualism that is inherent in conscious thinking is back here.\n",
            "[19:00.020 --> 19:12.580]  It is necessary to follow the master unquestioningly without comparing what he said in contrast or in consonance with some other thinker or sage.\n",
            "[19:13.300 --> 19:23.220]  Such an exercise is perhaps permissible during study or work but surely is suicidal during meditation in this path.\n",
            "[19:23.220 --> 19:32.660]  This is why master has asked us to meditate after offering the prayer silently in the thought of the divine light without luminosity.\n",
            "[19:33.380 --> 19:45.020]  When we remain silent without giving attention to any activity, our mind is quiet and has no power to distort and no ideas with which to identify the self.\n",
            "[19:45.700 --> 19:52.580]  It is then the prayer alone is heard and it is the company of the master that alone attracts our attention.\n",
            "[19:53.900 --> 20:10.100]  We get merged in it to be aware of the master who has accepted us and that is introduction into pam and to accept him totally as our only friend and beloved is to get initiated in the path.\n",
            "[20:10.100 --> 20:24.160]  There are no external rituals to be observed for either but internally we need to offer our heart and soul to him and externally dedicate ourselves totally to his cause.\n",
            "[20:24.160 --> 20:38.120]  When we feel him in our heart all the time and love him all the time, then we will not be out of the state of the union and the breathless embrace of the master is felt more intensely during meditation.\n",
            "[20:39.180 --> 20:44.900]  Such an embrace is what we had just now even as we have it every time we dwell in him.\n",
            "[20:44.900 --> 20:45.820]  But without further ado.\n",
            "[20:45.880 --> 20:46.660]  For that number.\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling.
